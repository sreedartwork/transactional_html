HTML email transactional
This project was based on an email I received from Capital One.  I used the Foundation for emails frame-work this allowed me to cut down the time it takes to do an Html email. Foundation for emails had very clear documentation that was easy to follow and understand the components. Foundation includes a gulp file that has production build and browser-sync for live-reload. I checked this project in Mail Chimp and my personal email for quality.
